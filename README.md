Internet of Things network level security audit tool.

This was a tool I created as part of my final year project in Liverpool John Moores University for my project: Reducing the IoT attack surface with the use of network level security auditing.

The audience of this tool were those with absolutely no prior security experience so there is an emphasis on keeping the tool as basic for the user as possible.
